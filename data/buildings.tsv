A competition was held in 1866 for the Chapel design as a Civil War memorial chapel. Standing on the corner of College and Elm streets, between Durfee and Farnam halls, this High Victorian Gothic building of rough brown New Jersey and Ohio sandstone was designed by Russell Sturgis, Jr. Robbins Battell, BA 1839, and Mrs. Ellen Battell Eldridge presented the chimes, consisting of five bells, in 1882. In 1893 the seating capacity was increased by an addition to the south by Cady, Berg & See, Architects. An extensive renovation took place in 1927 under the direction of Everett V. Meeks. The chapel has many memorials recording service to the University by members of the faculty. Andrew F. Euston planned and supervised the remodeling of the memorial apse, and designed the carving on altar, reredos, and stalls, dedicated October 5, 1947, to sixteen undergraduate deacons who died in the Second World War.

It is the single remaining Georgian college building at Yale. Built between 1750 and 1753 by masons Francis Letort and Thomas Bills, it was constructed as a three-story brick.  Funds were secured through a lottery held by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1747, the sale of a French vessel taken by the frigate belonging to the Colony, and a grant from the Connecticut Assembly in 1751. In 1797 John Trumbull added a fourth story. He felt the original roof did not blend with buildings planned in the adjacent area, so at great expense the gambrel roof was rebuilt in a Modish Adam style.  In 1882 the dormitory was thoroughly remodeled and known as South Middle College until 1905, when alumni funds financed another remodeling under Grosvenor Atterbury, Architect. The original roofline and name (Connecticut Hall) was resumed. 1909 to 1941 the first floor was used for offices of the Dean of Yale College. Through a gift from the Old Dominion Foundation (founded by Paul Mellon, BA 1929) renovation again took place in 1952-54 by the Office of Douglas Orr and Richard A. Kimball. The building was gutted and the interior completely rebuilt.  It now provides the Yale College faculty meeting room, Literature and Philosophy departmental offices, seminar rooms, and a basement computer lab, National Historic Landmark & the Landmark plaque of New Haven Preservation Trust.

2705	OPEN	BRITISH ART, YALE CTR	[]	06510	CEN	-72.930972	CHAPEL ST, 1080	Yale Center for British Art	CHAPEL STREET, 1080	NEW HAVEN, CT	YCBA	41.307776	This art gallery and study center, opened on April 19, 1977. The Center was founded in 1968 with gifts made to Yale by Paul Mellon BA 1929. It houses a nearly encyclopedic survey of the pictorial arts in Britain from Elizabethan times until the middle of the nineteenth century, including more than 1,500 paintings, 20,000 prints, 10,000 drawings, 20,000 rare books, and a small representative group of sculptures. Marshall Meyers, of the firm of Pellecchia and Meyers Architects completed the building, designed by Louis I. Kahn before his death in 1974.  The center is 200 feet long and 120 feet wide and rises four stories. A series of small shops, incorporated into the structure at street level, serves to maintain the traditional commercial activity of the street and to animate the otherwise austere facade of the concrete frame, filled with dull “pewter- finish “ stainless steel panels, punctuated by reflective plate glass windows. The interior, by contrast, integrates the public exhibition galleries and study facilities by means of a series of finely appointed, room-like spaces gathered around two open interior courts, brightly lit by skylights. The skylights, covering the entire roof, contain baffles, filters, and diffusers, which modify light and screen out the direct rays of the sun. White oak paneling, linen-covered walls, and natural wool carpeting bordered by strips of travertine marble present a low-contrast background to the works of art. In addition to exhibition galleries, the center contains a print, drawing, and rare book study, a reference library, a photographic archive, a paper conservation laboratory, a lecture hall, faculty offices, and classrooms.

Mrs. Alexander McBurney Byers of Pittsburgh gave it to the University in 1901 in memory of her husband and their son, Alexander McBurney Byers, Jr., and PH.B. 1894. The site was a bequest from John Phelps Atwater, BA 1834, and M.D. 1837. The architects, Hiss & Weekes, used Indiana limestone in a modified French Renaissance style to harmonize with the bicentennial buildings opposite. The University Treasurer had his office in Byers Hall from 1933 to 1939. The front of the building was altered, the entrance stairs eliminated, and the interior remodeled when this building was made a part of Silliman College. The Hall underwent an extensive interior restoration in 1992 after sustaining serious fire damage.  Vanderbilt-Scientific Halls  were built in 1903-06, the gift of Frederick W. Vanderbilt, PH.B. 1875, as a memorial to his brother, Cornelius Vanderbilt, MA Hon. 1894. They are Industrial Collegiate Gothic dormitories of Indiana limestone.

The original building of seam-faced granite, Indiana limestone, Briar Hill sandstone (and other stone from Idaho, Virginia and Connecticut) was completed in June 1921. The cornerstone was laid on October 8, 1917, the two-hundredth anniversary of the raising of the first college building, but construction was interrupted by World War I. This first extensive dormitory built by the university was the gift of Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness of New York City. It honors her son, William Harkness, BA 1883, who had died in 1916. The quadrangle, ""Collegiate Gothic"" in style, with its warm Medieval English Manor flavor imparts a welcoming, residential feeling to what is essentially an extensive student housing unit. It is the prototype for all of Yale’s cloistered colleges, being composed of a cluster of various sized halls surrounding interior courts. As well as the student rooms, each college has rooms for Fellows, a common room, a dining hall, activity rooms in the basement and a Master’s House. James Gamble Rogers was the architect for the original construction and the conversion. The work was made possible by the generosity of Edward S. Harkness.  Branford College containing 157, 642 gross square feet, was named for the town in which a group of Connecticut ministers met in 1701 to establish in the Colony the Collegiate School which later became Yale University. This is a complex of many different buildings arranged around several courts and fills the southern part of the block bounded by York Street, Library Walk, and High Street.  Main gates from York and High streets lead to Branford Court, with access to Brothers in Unity, Calliope and Linonia courts. The heights of the buildings vary from two to four stories.  The main High Street entrance is flanked by Harkness Tower designed to complement the Collegiate Gothic style of the complex. Elaborately decorated carvings, Gothic arches, pinnacle, and turrets are woven within the architectural facade.  The Memorial Room at its base is now known as Branford College Chapel, dedicated in 1952 to the thirty-five members of the College who gave their lives serving their country in 1941-1951. The ten tower bells were replaced by one of the world's finest carillons in 1966, with the installation forty-four bells (the gift of an anonymous donor) that came from Loughborough, England, where the original bells were made.

It was assigned to the American Red Cross from 1945 to 1958.

The residence was purchase three years later by Yale President Noah Porter, who had it extensively remodeled between 1866 and 1870 by Henry Austin. Renovations included the mansard roof addition, bargeboards with filigreed angles, and two Victorian porches. Upon Noah Porter’s demise in 1992, the house was bequeathed to his two daughters, Misses Rebecca Taylor and Martha Day Porte. Further renovations were completed in the early 20th century, returning the house to Federal style (the porches were removed during the course of this work.) Miss Martha Porter bequeathed the property to the University in 1919 subject to life use by Miss Porter. The house has been used as a residence for University administrators.

This house was built in 1836 to designs by Alexander Jackson Davis rendered in the Greek revival style, popular in the first half of the 19th century. Ira Atwater and Nelson Hotchkiss served as the builders. The tall Corinthian porch, white columns, and cream-colored smooth stucco cladding emphasise this structure’s classical character. Mr. David C. Collins purchased the house in 1850. He died in 1861 and his widow, Clarissa, resided there until her death at age 100 in 1914. Mr. Henry H. Townsend lived in the house until 1953. Some time during this period, a remodeling project removed the original main roof parapet and the antiflexes at the porch roof, and added bay windows and a rear wing. The residence was acquired by the University in 1953 and served for a short time as a dormitory for engineering graduate students.

Town and Davis were the architects and Nahum Hayward the builder. It is a two-story Greek revival residence, built similar to and to compliment the grand Hillhouse Mansion at the top of the hill in Sachem’s Woods.  There is a two-story main portico fronting Hillhouse with tall slender windows whose profile extends to the portico floor, and the stucco exterior is scored to give the impression of large blocks of dressed marble, giving the mansion a true Temple effect.  When completed in 1839, it became one of the most distinguished homes on the Avenue.  Shortly after Mr. Skinner’ s death (1858) Judge William Boardman acquired the property. He remodeled the house on designs by Henry Austin. This work filled in the second story angles that flank the portico, changing the cruciform plan to cube. The house was purchased in 1908 by Rutherford  Trowbridge and in 1910 a large, sweeping center stair hall, music room and expanded dining room were completed, with a wing to the west and a bay to the north. The  curved leaded glass dining room windows and grand side entrance doors were taken from the demolished Trowbridge home on the Green.  The house remained in the Trowbridge family until the death of Miss Rachel Trowbridge, when the estate became the property of the University. The house is being restored and renovated in 1999 for use by the neighboring the School of Management.

ART GALLERY	[]	06510	CEN	-72.930815	CHAPEL ST, 1111	the New Art Museum	CHAPEL STREET, 1111	NEW HAVEN, CT	YUAG	41.308313	In 1928, the Yale School of Fine Arts moved from the Art Building (now known as Street Hall) into this four-story “expansion “  building.   Considered “Tuscan Romanesque,” this solid and monumental structure of Aquila sandstone (Ohio sandstone trim) is linked to Street Hall by an elegant bridge that arches over High Street (it houses a grand high-ceilinged  gallery). The true visual appearance of architect Edgerton Swartwout’s planned gallery can not be appreciated, as he intended the gallery to be extended along Chapel Street when additional funds were made available  (original funding, Edward S. Harkness, BA 1897, MA HON. 1925). The  new wing of the Art Gallery (of an equal visual mass): the proposed extension along Chapel Street, was not the romantic design of Mr. Swartwout, but the 1953 bold modernistic brick and glass creation of Louis I. Kahn (with the Office of Douglas Orr).  His four-story geometric box contrasts sharply with the ornate buildings surrounding it. Kahn used string courses to delineate interior floor lines to scale down and break up his massive unrelieved brick walls along Chapel Street ) contrasted with Swartwout’s use of medieval elements to resolve this same issue).  In the rear, Kahn’s three tiered rear courtyards serve as  sculpture  garden and outdoor retreat. The gardens, with their picturesque view of the cluster of  mediaeval English  styled  buildings beyond (Jonathan Edwards College and Weir Hall) are seen to good advantage from  well-placed window walls on each floor of the gallery. This building was Kahn’s first public commission and the first building in modern style on the Yale Campus ) funded by gifts of alumni and friends). In 1965 renovations created a design center (architect: Carlton Granbery) and between 1974 and 1976 portions of the building complex were expanded and renovated. In 1971 the Cambridge Seven Association designed the conversion of the large lecture room and adjacent exhibition areas to provide space and offices for the Yale Center for American Art and Material Culture (the Garvin Collection) . In 1977, an underground lecture hall was constructed beneath the sculpture garden between the Art Gallery and Weir Hall (architect: Herbert S. Newman and Associates). The Art Gallery is home to  more than forty thousand works of art. This includes the Garvan Collection of American painting and decorative arts, twentieth-century and old master paintings and sculptures, and a large collection of prints, drawings and photographs. There is also on display Greek and Roman antiquities,  artifacts from Dura-Europa,  African and pre-Columbian art, and Oriental art. As previously mentioned, sculpture is exhibited in the three courtyards.  Part of the original building is used by the History of Art Department. Colonel John Trumbull 1756-1843 (his painting of the American Revolution formed the nucleus for a Gallery of Art at Yale College in 1832) and his wives are buried in a vault in the original gallery’s basement.
